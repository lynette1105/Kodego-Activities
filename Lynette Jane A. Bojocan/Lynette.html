                    <p>Miya, Moonlight Archer, is a hero in Mobile Legends: Bang Bang. She is the first hero in the game according to "Sale Time" as well as its official mascot, as seen in the end of every trailer and advertisements and the application icon. Miya lived in Azrya with the other Moon Elves. She stood aloof from worldly strife, and did not expect the Demon army would attack suddenly. In order to protect her homeland, Miya, as the Priestess of the Moon, led the other Moon Elves in a defense against foreign enemies. Miya knelt in the center of the temple to pray, for one last time when she realized that all hope was lost. Then, a miracle occurred. The moon God answered Miya's prayer and blessed her longbow with an ancient relic power. Miya grasped the newly endowed bow and fired an arrow, and with the power of the stars, the arrow turned into an eagle spirit and sunk the enemy into chaos. Miya led her people out of the temple, raining showers of star-wrought arrows upon the enemy with each pull of her bow. Meanwhile, the magical eagle hovered the enemy, singling them out and attacking them. Like a falling tide, the humans and orcs quickly started to retreat. Miya and her countrymen retook the shores of the Moon God, and the moon elves recognized Miya and her spirit eagle as the Moon God incarnated. The young Miya knew, within her heart that if this problem was not stopped at the root, the wars would never end. With the Moon God's blessing, she set out on a journey to the Land of Dawn, hoping to find a king, who could bring peace and order to this world.</p>

                    <p>Layla lives in a world where there is a force called Malefic Energy. Any living being that comes in contact with this "savage and unruly energy" will lose their sanity and become "rabidly ferocious". Layla's father discovered a process to control the Malefic Energy by letting a gun forged from magic iron absorb the energy. During the forging process, Layla's father died due to too much exposure and absorption. Before the unfortunate event, Layla's father managed to complete the gun and gave it to Layla in the hopes of halting the spread of Malefic Energy.</p> <br> <br>

                    <p>Lesley grew up in the Vance household, where her father presided over the noble family's security. During an unexpected attack by a rival family, Lesley's father was killed. As the assailants approached the Vance household, Lesley took up her father's black long rifle and fulfilled her late father's mission. Tears rolled down Lesley's cheeks as she fired shot after shot, surprisingly, each one taking down an assassin. The final tear came as the final shot took down the last of the rival family's men.

                        Lesley was adopted by the Vance family, with the patriarch of the noble house even putting their sole heir, Harley under her tutelage. Harley, was a natural troublemaker, who used his talents in magic to unintentionally cause trouble for the Vance household. Only Lesley could keep Harley under control. Harley's troublemaking streak was the last part of warmth within Lesley's conscience.
                        
                        After hearing about how Harley had travelled to the dangerous Land of Dawn after defeating the Boss of Dark Magic, Lesley followed him, along with her trusty heirloom rifle. After she found Harley through a long arduous journey, she discovered that the once immature young boy [has] changed through the numerous life experiences he had gone through. She decided it would be best to have her adopted little brother train, alone, while she would silently protect him from within the shadows. From that day on, all the monsters that were inflicted with Harley's magic would also be struck with a black bullet, that would impeccably pierce through their heart. The stories of the magical youngster who was followed by a mysterious black sniper, soon spread across the Land of Dawn, like wild fire.</p>

                    <p>Growing up in the slums, Bruno was always thinner than his peers. These circumstances never stopped him from having a heart filled with freedom.

                        The scholars of Eruditio heard of Bruno's inspiring story and commended him for his bravery. Empathized with his tragedy and out of strong compassion, the scholars of used the City's latest technology to create synthetic legs for Bruno. When Bruno took his first step, he was shocked by this strange feeling of his synthetic legs, but was amazed by how running felt like flying.
                        
                        To express his gratitude, Bruno vowed to protect Eruditio till the day he dies. They elated City's scholars quickly developed an energy ball as Bruno's main weapon, specifically to be used with his synthetic legs. From that day forward, any invader who set foot in Eruditio was met by Bruno's relentless attack. The city people came to call him, "The Protector of Eruditio".</p>
